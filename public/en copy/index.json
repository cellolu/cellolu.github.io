I’m Minghua Lu, a passionate cellist and music educator.\nI am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Cello Performance at the University of Central Oklahoma, under the mentorship of Dr. Tess Remy-Schumacher. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Music Performance at Northeastern University (China), under the mentorship of Dr. Yijia Fang.\nWhat I’ve Done # Here are several positions I\u0026rsquo;ve been through:\nCurrent: # Principle Cellist, University of Central Oklahoma Symphony orchestra and chamber music, 01/2025 - now Research Assistant, University of Central Oklahoma, 08/2024 - now Past: # Cellist, Shenyang Symphony Orchestra, 11/2023-12/2023 Principle Cellist, University of Northeastern University (China), 09/2020 - 06/2024 What I\u0026rsquo;ve Performed # Here are several classical and modern pieces I\u0026rsquo;ve been performing:\nClassical Music\nTheme \u0026amp; Variations - A. Glazunov 5th Symphony in C minor Op.67 - Beethoven Danzon No.2 - Gustavo Dudamel Caemina Burana - Carl Orff Crisantemi - G.

I love composing and exploring innovative techniques, blending classical traditions with modern elements to create unique musical experiences. I’m especially passionate about teaching, as I believe in nurturing the next generation of musicians to discover their own voices.\nA Little More About Me # Tutors # My graduate teacher, Dr. Tess, emphasizes my musical interpretation, while my undergraduate teacher, Dr. Fang, focuses heavily on cello technique and accuracy. The combination of their teaching approaches has provided me with a solid foundation and the necessary tools to achieve my desired musical expression.\nTeaching Experiences # With four years of private teaching experience in China, I have consistently emphasized foundational cello techniques in my lessons, including open string exercises, scales, and etudes. During my bachelor’s degree, I co-founded a music studio with fellow musicians, offering instruction in a variety of instruments such as erhu, violin, viola, pipa, piano, and cello. As the primary cello instructor, I not only taught individual lessons but also organized student recitals to showcase their progress. I genuinely enjoy teaching and have a natural ability to connect with students of all ages. My passion for music education drives me to inspire and guide my students in their musical journeys.\nI have a deep passion for music and truly enjoy the process of teaching the cello. As a performer, I strive to share my true self with the audience through music. Likewise, as a cello teacher, I hope to help my students genuinely discover their interest in music and find their own voice in their musical expression.\nI believe in creating an approachable and supportive learning environment where each student’s unique needs are met. My teaching methods are tailored to individual learning styles, ensuring that students remain engaged and motivated. I am passionate about fostering a love for music and strive to make lessons both enjoyable and enriching. With sincerity, patience, and a deep sense of responsibility, I aim to nurture not only technical skills but also a lifelong appreciation for music. I am experienced in preparing students for both the ABRSM examination system and domestic grading exams, ensuring they achieve their dreams.\nPersonal Life # When I’m not immersed in music, I enjoy:\nVolunteering: Sharing music through community events and art workshops. Swimming: A favorite way to stay active and unwind. Learning Languages: Expanding my cultural horizons and enhancing communication with diverse audiences. Let’s Connect! # Whether you’re here to explore my performances, collaborate, seek for cello education or simply learn more about my musical journey, I’m thrilled to share my passion with you.
