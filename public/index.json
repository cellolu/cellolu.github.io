I love composing and exploring new techniques, blending classical traditions with modern elements to create unique musical experiences. I’m particularly passionate about teaching because I firmly believe that helping the next generation of musicians find their own voice is incredibly meaningful.\nA Little More About Me # Tutors # My graduate advisor, Dr. Tess, placed a strong emphasis on developing my understanding and expression of music, while my undergraduate mentor, Dr. Fang, focused more on precision and solid cello technique. Their teaching styles complemented each other, giving me a solid foundation and the ability to express emotions through music.\nTeaching Experiences # I have four years of private teaching experience in China. In my lessons, I always prioritize foundational training, such as open-string exercises, scales, and etudes. During my undergraduate studies, I co-founded a music studio with a few friends, where we taught a variety of instruments, including erhu, violin, viola, pipa, piano, and cello. As the primary cello teacher, I not only taught one-on-one lessons but also organized student recitals to showcase their progress. I genuinely enjoy teaching and find it easy to connect with students of all ages. My passion for music education drives me to inspire and guide students as they grow on their musical journey.\nI have a deep love for music, and teaching cello is something I truly enjoy. As a performer, I strive to present my authentic self to the audience through music. Similarly, as a cello teacher, I hope to help students discover their own interest in music and explore their unique ways of musical expression.\nI’ve always believed that a learning environment should be relaxed and friendly, while also catering to each student’s individual needs. My teaching methods are flexible and tailored to different learning styles, ensuring that each lesson is engaging and motivating. Through my teaching, I aim not only to help students master technical skills but also to foster a genuine love for music. I approach teaching with sincerity, patience, and a strong sense of responsibility. I have extensive experience preparing students for ABRSM exams and domestic grading systems, and I’m committed to helping them achieve their goals.\nPersonal Life # Beyond music, I have a variety of other interests:\nVolunteering: I enjoy participating in community events and sharing the joy of music with others. Swimming: It’s my favorite way to stay energized and relax. Learning languages: It helps me better understand different cultures and connect with people from around the world. Let’s Connect! # Whether you’re interested in my performances, looking for collaboration opportunities, seeking cello lessons, or simply want to chat about my musical journey, I’d be delighted to share my passion with you.
